# **Grafana-Prometheus-Python-Monitoring-System**

This repository automates the process of setting up a monitoring system using **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Python** to monitor infrastructure and application metrics. The system is designed to collect, visualize, and store real-time performance and health data, providing insights into system status and allowing for proactive monitoring and issue detection.

## **Project Features**

- **Prometheus Integration**: Collects system metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory, disk, etc.) from various monitored entities.
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Visualizes Prometheus data through custom Grafana dashboards for easy monitoring and alerting.
- **Python Scripts**: Automates the setup, configuration, and management of Prometheus and Grafana services using Python scripts for simplicity and reproducibility.
- **Alerting**: Set up alert rules in Prometheus to notify when specific thresholds are exceeded.
- **Scalability**: Designed to be easily scalable to monitor multiple systems or services by extending Prometheus and Grafana configurations.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Prometheus**: Open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability.
- **Grafana**: Open-source data visualization tool for creating rich, interactive dashboards.
- **Python**: For scripting the automation of monitoring setup and management.
  
## **Getting Started**
To get started, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up Prometheus and Grafana using the provided Python automation scripts.
3. Customize Prometheus data sources and Grafana dashboards as needed for your environment.
4. Monitor and visualize your infrastructure metrics in Grafana.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Integrating additional monitoring sources (e.g., databases, applications).
- Adding custom alerts and automating responses.
- Enhancing the Python scripts to support a wider range of configurations.
